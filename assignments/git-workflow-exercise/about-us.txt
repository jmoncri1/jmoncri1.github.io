Catalyte believes that aptitude is equally distributed, but opportunity is not.
We find hidden technology talent others can’t. The company provides new 
opportunities for sustainable and diverse tech talent that powers 
transformational software engineering ‒ when, where, and how it’s needed – and 
accelerates business outcomes.

Even the most forward-looking companies struggle to find and keep the 
exceptional technology talent needed to maintain a competitive edge. With our 
proprietary Odyssey workforce development platform we find, develop and support
a new talent pool of great software engineers, narrowing the talent gap for 
Fortune 1000 companies.

Catalyte founder Michael Rosenbaum was a Harvard economics and law fellow. As 
an advisor in the Clinton White House, he proposed the theory that underserved
urban populations contain just as many people with talent to succeed in the 
emerging FIELD of software development as any other. They are just overlooked 
by a system that values pedigree rather than innate ABILITY.

To prove this point, Michael built a big DATA engine that REMOVES BIASES from 
hiring and objectively selects CANDIDATES who have the potential to become 
great software engineers. With 20 years of data proving that great software 
developers can come from anywhere, Catalyte continues to CREATE local, 
cost-effective, predictable, diverse and SUSTAINABLE technology workforces 
aligned with customers’ software development and BUSINESS priorities.
