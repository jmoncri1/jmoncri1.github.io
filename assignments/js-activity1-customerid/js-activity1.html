<!--1. The title of the web page must be the company name.
a. The title should be centered,
b. The title font should be in the Arial family.
c. The title color should be blue.
2. The next section of the website should show a table.
a. The table must be four columns across
i. The table must have a border and have delineation between each cell.
ii. Column 1 should be customer_id.
iii. Column 2 should be Last Purchase Quantity.
iv. Column 3 should be Last Purchase Amount (in dollars).
b. The table must contain a row for every customer.
i. Each row represents a unique customer
3. Your manager will present this web page to the investor and expects the investor tol ask
follow-up questions about the individual customers.
a. Because it is typically bad-practice to show identifying customer data on the
website itself, your manager would like to utilize the console log to show the
investor more details about each customer on demand.
4. However, your company is so brand new that your manager can only provide you with a
receipt book that holds the first five customers’ most recent purchases.
a. id: 001; Last : Smith; First: Jacob; Quantity: 5, Total AMT Purchased: $50
b. id: 002; Last : Johnson; First: Iris; Quantity: 10, Total AMT Purchased: $100
c. id: 003; Last : Perez; First: Javier; Quantity: 5, Total AMT Purchased: $50
d. id: 004; Last : Thomas; First: Henry; Quantity: 20, Total AMT Purchased: $200
e. id: 005; Last : Smith; First: Janice; Quantity: 10, Total AMT Purchased: $100
Objective:
1. Create a website that satisfies the structure and layout criteria described above.
2. Create an Customer object using Javascript (in your script.js file) that includes the
following properties:
a. customer_id
b. last_name
c. first_name
d. last_purchase_quantity
e. Last_purchase_amount_in_dollars
3. Write a function that allows your manager to gather more information about any
customer from your object. Your manager should be able to pass the customer’s id to the
function in the web page’s console log.
a. Hint: Your manager must be able to utilize the web page’s console log to return a
sentence that they will read word for word to describe the requested customer to
the investor. (For example, if the investor requests more information on customer
003, your leader should be able to request more information about customer 003
in the console log.)-->
