<main>

<p>I, Jazmarie Moncrieft, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER 2022, CRO7000-01:CO programing,  with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>

<p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private</p>

<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
</p>

<p>Signed:<em>Jazmarie Moncrieft</em> </p>
