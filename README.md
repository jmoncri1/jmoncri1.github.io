Begining my career in Software development, many of the frontend projects are completed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are projects completed using react as well. The backend projects are completed using Java, maven, and springboot. Feel free to explore. Click on the link below to go to my webpage where you can navigate to some of the frontend projects.
